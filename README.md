# EnmityPlugin

This plugin has been deprecated.

The [ngld OverlayPlugin](https://github.com/ngld/OverlayPlugin/) now includes enmity data.
You cannot use old enmity overlay html files with the new ngld OverlayPlugin.
However, its release include new replacement enmity overlays that should have everything
the old ones did.

Please install and use that instead.
